# Impact

### Mathematical Model
We model hard contact via constraints on the system’s configuration and the applied contact forces. For a system with $P$ contact points, we define a signed-distance function,

```math 
\phi : \mathbf{Z} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^P
```

subject to the following element-wise constraint:

```math
ϕ(z) > 0,
```

Impact forces with magnitude ``\gamma \in \mathbf{R}^P`` are applied to the bodies’ contact points in the direction of their surface normals in order to enforce (5) and prevent interpenetration. A non-negative constraint,

```math
\gamma \geq 0,
```

enforces physical behavior that impulses are repulsive (e.g., the floor does not attract bodies), and the complementarity condition,

```math 
\gamma \circ \phi(z) = 0,
```

where ``\circ`` is an element-wise product operator, enforces zero force if the body is not in contact and allows non-zero force during contact.
