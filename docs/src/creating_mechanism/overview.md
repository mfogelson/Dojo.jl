# Overview

There are three ways to to build and use mechanical systems in Dojo: Build it directly, use an existing mechanism, or use an existing environment. Directly-built and existing mechanism both result in a [`Mechanism`](@ref), and using an existing mechanism is just for convenience. Creating an `Environment` can be useful for more advanced applications like reinforcement learning. We use the pendulum as a simple example for these three methods and later give two more detailed examples.
